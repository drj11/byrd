Byrd
====

The station at Byrd has a published reconstruction of its
temperature series.

The program `dat.py` converts the `byrd.txt` file to GHCN-M v3 format.

The `byrd.txt` file needs to be extracted from the
`GISTEMPv3_sources.tar.gz` file (at the location
`GISTEMP_sources/STEP0/input_files/byrd.txt`) published by NASA GISS.
